## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, you need to have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.x**: The backend of this project is built using Python.
   - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **pip**: Python package installer (usually comes with Python installation).
3. **Git**: For cloning the repository.
   - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. **A text editor/IDE**: Such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or PyCharm.

You also need a **web browser** to access the application locally (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project set up on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ulove-wonders.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd ulove-wonders
Create and activate a virtual environment (Optional but recommended):

This step ensures that all Python dependencies are contained in a virtual environment and won’t conflict with system-wide packages.

For Windows:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install required dependencies:

Install all necessary Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the libraries listed in requirements.txt, including Flask, Jinja2, and other dependencies.

Set up environment variables:

You will need to create a .env file for setting up environment variables such as your database URI, secret key for Flask sessions, and other settings.

Create a .env file in the root of your project directory.

Add the following variables:

makefile
Copy code
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
Replace your_secret_key and your_database_url with your actual values.

Setting Up the Environment
Install Node.js (for frontend development, if applicable):

If you are using any front-end build tools like Webpack or Babel, you will need Node.js.

Download Node.js

After installation, run the following command to verify:

bash
Copy code
node -v
Install front-end dependencies (if applicable):

If your project includes a front-end, you might need to install JavaScript dependencies using npm or yarn:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Project Locally
After setting everything up, you can run the project locally by following these steps:

Run the Flask application:

In your terminal, run the following command to start the development server:

bash
Copy code
flask run
This will start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Open the application in a browser:

Open a web browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You should see the U-LOVE Wonders platform running locally.

Testing
To ensure the project works as expected, you can run the tests.

Run unit tests (if you have a test suite in place):

You can run the tests with:

bash
Copy code
pytest
Make sure to install pytest first if you don’t have it:

bash
Copy code
pip install pytest
Deployment
If you are ready to deploy your application, consider using platforms like Netfly, AWS, or Google Cloud.

Deploy to Netlify.

Access, github through netlify and deploy the web application
